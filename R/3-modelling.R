# Tasks to accomplish

#
#   1. Build basic n-gram model
#       using the exploratory analysis you performed, build a basic n-gram model
#       (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) for predicting the next word based
#       on the previous 1, 2, or 3 words.
#
#   2. Build a model to handle unseen n-grams
#       in some cases people will want to type a combination of words that does
#       not appear in the corpora. Build a model to handle cases where a
#       particular n-gram isn't observed.
